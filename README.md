# inegiChartR :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
Create for dashboard or shiny ready html charts using [inegiR](https://github.com/Eflores89/inegiR) package and [highcharter](https://github.com/jbkunst/highcharter).

# Purpose
Getting data from INEGI (Mexican Statistics Agency) is cleverly easy using the [inegiR](https://github.com/Eflores89/inegiR) package, but what if you want to graph? 
ggplot2 is great, but getting it to look "publishable" requires some tinkering while [highcharter](https://github.com/jbkunst/highcharter) has a universe of options to configure,
why not just "pack" the basics into one? This is my idea behind this package: create a chart of INEGI data using as few code as possible.
